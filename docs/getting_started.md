# Getting Started with Kyrox

This guide will help you understand the basic concepts of Kyrox and how to use it effectively.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Agents

Agents are autonomous entities that can perform specific tasks. Each agent has:
- A set of capabilities (e.g., data processing, text analysis)
- An operational status (idle, busy, error, offline)
- Performance metrics (tasks completed, success rate)

```python
from kyrox import Agent

agent = Agent(
    name="data_processor",
    capabilities=["data_processing", "pattern_recognition"]
)
```

### 2. Networks

Networks are collections of agents that work together. They handle:
- Agent management and coordination
- Task distribution and load balancing
- Resource allocation
- Inter-agent communication

```python
from kyrox import AgentNetwork

network = AgentNetwork(name="research_network")
network.add_agent(agent)
```

### 3. Tasks

Tasks are units of work that can be executed by agents. They include:
- Required capabilities
- Priority level
- Input parameters
- Success criteria

```python
from kyrox import Task

task = Task(
    name="analyze_data",
    requirements=["data_processing"],
    priority="HIGH",
    parameters={
        "data_source": "market_feed",
        "analysis_type": "trend"
    }
)
```

## Basic Usage

### 1. Setting Up a Network

```python
from kyrox import AgentNetwork, Agent

# Create a network
network = AgentNetwork(name="my_network")

# Add agents with different capabilities
network.add_agent(Agent(
    name="collector",
    capabilities=["data_collection"]
))

network.add_agent(Agent(
    name="analyzer",
    capabilities=["data_analysis"]
))
```

### 2. Creating and Executing Tasks

```python
# Define a task
task = Task(
    name="market_analysis",
    requirements=["data_analysis"],
    priority="HIGH"
)

# Execute the task
result = network.execute_task(task)
```

### 3. Creating Workflows

```python
# Define a sequence of tasks
workflow = [
    {
        "task": "collect_data",
        "source": "market_feeds"
    },
    {
        "task": "analyze_trends",
        "timeframe": "7d"
    },
    {
        "task": "generate_report",
        "format": "summary"
    }
]

# Execute the workflow
results = network.execute_workflow(workflow)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Agent Design**
   - Give agents focused capabilities
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Monitor agent performance

2. **Task Management**
   - Set appropriate priorities
   - Include clear success criteria
   - Provide complete input parameters

3. **Network Configuration**
   - Balance agent distribution
   - Monitor network health
   - Implement failover strategies
